<h3>Challenge </h3>

<p>
SJET Student Journey Experience Taskforce is a program initiated by Macquarie University in the year of 2017. The objective of the program is to look at student experiences as a whole. Through foundational user research, it was discovered that MQ students experience a lack of belonging to the university, particularly when the online/hybrid learning model was introduced due to the pandemic. Students expressed their longing to received more personalised communications from the university, develop meaningful interactions with their peers & staff to feel a stronger sense of community and inclusivity at Macquarie University.</p>

<h3>Quantitative research </h3>

<p>
  Prior to conducting further user research, initial product concepts were explored based on the user insights generated from the foundational research.
</p>
<p>
In order to validate the research insights & product concepts as well as further explore product opportunities, we conducted surveys to current Macquarie university students and university students from other major Australian universities.</p>



<h5>Survey specifics </h5>

<p>
  Prior to conducting further user research, initial product concepts were explored based on the user insights generated from the foundational research.
</p>
<p>
In order to validate the research insights & product concepts as well as further explore product opportunities, we conducted online surveys to current Macquarie university students and university students from other major Australian universities. Two separate surveys were created for MQ students & other uni students to surface any gaps & uncover opportunities.

</p>

<p>
In survey, participants were asked to give their definitions of belonging, their experiences of working with others for academic projects & hobby projects, their experiences of university campus, university social programs such as mentor/mentee program, inclusive programs and more. Lastly, participants were asked to rate their likelihood to use a mobile application with features that tackle a sense of belonging at university.

 INSIGHT SYNTHESIS  </p>

    <hr class="darkHR">


    <h3>Research insight   </h3>
    <p class="colored-section">
      Through synthesising survey results from both Macquarie uni participants & other uni participants, following insights began to emerge:
    </p>


    <ul>
      <li>Participants considered a sense of  community , feeling welcomed, feeling safe to express themselves,  building friendship both online & offline of great importance when it comes to feel a sense of belonging at university.

    </li>
      <li>Participants longed for the opportunities to meet more peers with similar degrees of studies and common interests.

    </li>

    <li> When it comes to university communications, it is essential to create a centralised place where students are expected to develop a habit of checking & being informed

    </li>

    <li> When it comes to social/student event communications, Students expect to be notified with information of relevance (e.g., related to their studies/interests) rather than having to search for it

    </li>


    <li> There are substantial needs from uni students to collaborate with their peers on hobby & passion projects as a way to meet like-minded peers & build friendship outside of classroom & therefore develop a sense of community
    </li>

    </ul>

      <h3>Product concept </h3>

      <h5>Overview </h5>


<p>Based on the user insights, we identified a product opportunity that incorporates product features to meet user needs of feeling belonged & having a sense of community through personalised university communications, enabled online & offline socialisation with peers of same studies and common interests & building friendship through shared interests & meaningful interactions.</p>

<h5>Key features </h5>


      <ul>
        <li>Personalisation at the start: survey at the start of app to collect personal info e.g., degree of study, interests, special needs. Students receive ongoing communication based on their needs
  </li>
        <li>Personalised landing page: students easily access contents that are relevant to their interests/needs instead of general promotion.
</li>
<li>Cultivating a sense of belonging to MQ in their local community: Hybrid/online learning has hindered studentâ€™s capability of meeting on campus. The mobile app allows online learners to socialised with other MQ students in their local areas.



</li>

<li>Passion project collaboration: students can interact with peers in a meaningful way through collaborating on a variety of projects, e.g., design hackathon, short film, guitar jam etc.



</li>
<li>Connecting to MQ campus: while getting to know all the featured buildings & facilities at MQ, students can also initiate an on-campus event, such as a study group, a sport game, a coffee chat etc. by posting the events in their groups.


</li>

      </ul>
